What is the VS Code Server?

In VS Code, we want users to seamlessly leverage the environments that make them the most productive. The VS Code Remote Development extensions allow you to work in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

We now provide a standalone "VS Code Server," which is a service built off the same underlying server used by the remote extensions, plus some additional functionality, like an interactive CLI and facilitating secure connections to vscode.dev.
