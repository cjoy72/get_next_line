What is the VS Code Server?

In VS Code, we want users to seamlessly leverage the environments that make them the most productive. The VS Code Remote Development extensions allow you to work in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), remote machines via SSH, and dev containers directly from VS Code. These extensions install a server on the remote environment, allowing local VS Code to smoothly interact with remote source code and runtimes.

We now provide a standalone "VS Code Server," which is a service built off the same underlying server used by the remote extensions, plus some additional functionality, like an interactive CLI and facilitating secure connections to vscode.dev.
