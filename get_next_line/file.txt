Secure website certificates (those with addresses starting with https://) have a limited validity duration. If your computer's date doesn't align with a website's certificate validity dates, Firefox will display an error, as it can't confirm the site's security.

To resolve this, ensure your computer's date, time, and time zone are accurate. If the issue persists, it might be due to other factors like a server misconfiguration or an outdated certificate.
